Prediction of Seat-Off towards assistance for Sit-to-Stand movement by RBFN

We have used a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFN) to learn a relation between inputs and the event. In this piece of work, we have predicted the seat-off event of multiple healthy human subjects through the RBFN network. Due to salient features of the RBFN network such as easy designing, good generalization and strong tolerance to noise we have employed RBFN in our work in predicting seat-off. 
The method used allows reliable event prediction with joint angles as inputs. This model will be flexible to people as it will recognize the pattern for different people and work accordingly.
